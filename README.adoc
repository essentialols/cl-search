== Why

My interest in web scraping began in 2018 when I was desperate to buy a
https://www.modcan.com/emodules/dualdelay.html[Modcan Dual Delay] for my
Eurorack collection and stumbled across https://wigglehunt.com/[WiggleHunt].
Since then, Iâ€™ve found the utility of organizing used items for sale from
across a variety of different websites genius. I built CL Search to solve this
problem.
